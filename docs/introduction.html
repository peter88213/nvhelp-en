<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This chapter is about the role of computer software for novelists,
and how <em>novelibre</em> fits in.</p>
<section id="office-software-vs-writing-software">
<h2>Office software vs. writing software<a class="headerlink" href="#office-software-vs-writing-software" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you want to write a novel on your PC, you generally
have the choice between
an office word processor or special writing software
(plain text editors are neglected at this point).</p>
<p>Office software is readily available, widely used, efficient and proven.
There is literature and training courses available.
Many people use office software professionally and are familiar with
its  basic functions, so there is no particular difficulty to use
it when “writing part-time”.</p>
<p>However, anyone writing a large novel will sooner or later reach a point
where the story threatens to become overwhelming.
You may already have outlines, notes, planning documents, synopsis drafts,
chapter overviews and so on, but as the manuscript grows,
it becomes increasingly difficult to keep these documents up to date.
Rearranging sections and chapters, introducing additional storylines,
maintaining chronological coherence - all this can become a serious challenge
at the latest during revision.</p>
<p>This is where specialized writing software comes in.
It generally offers better tools than office software to break
down a novel into small pieces and to provide these pieces with all the
additional information which would otherwise consist of notebooks, spreadsheets,
supplementary documents and sticky notes.
The main purpose of this software is therefore to keep the big picture
of the story in view, even if the story is constantly being expanded,
shortened or restructured.
If you move a part of the text, the summaries, notes, word count information,
and everything that falls under the term “metadata” move with it,
so that everything always fits together.</p>
<p>Many writing programs also offer access to the collected digital research
material so that
everything is in one place and users only need one program for all their work.
Of course, this requires a certain willingness to learn.
Some writing programs have an operating concept that deviates from the standards
of office software.
This can be a hurdle for authors who do not enjoy experimenting with their PC.
In addition, the word processing function of free writing software
in particular is not always as mature as we are used to with office software.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-novelibre">
<h2>Why novelibre?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-novelibre" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I have worked with office word processors for decades and have come
to appreciate their advantages.
At the same time, it was a pleasure for me to try out every piece of
writing software that came my way, always on the lookout for the perfect program.
For a while, that seemed to be
<a class="reference external" href="https://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html">yWriter</a>.
It is free and stable, and you can use it especially in conjunction with an
“external text editor”, i.e. an office word processor.
So you can structure and overview your novel with <em>yWriter</em> and write with
OpenOffice at the same time.
The developer of <em>yWriter</em> is a prolific writer himself and his
software is very efficient in supporting especially his workflow.</p>
<p>However, there are other approaches to novel writing for which <em>yWriter</em>
does not offer support out of the box.
This mainly involves dramaturgical structures (e.g. the “three-act model”
or the “hero’s journey”) and storytelling with several narrative strands
or plot lines.
There are impressive solutions for this in the commercial sector, such as
<em>DramaQueen</em> or <em>Causality</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like programming, and that’s how <em>novelibre</em> came about,
another writing program that tries to combine the advantages
of very different software.
You can see <em>novelibre</em> as a supplement to LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
It manages the structure and metadata of the novel and, in addition to the
actual manuscript, generates a selection of Office text and spreadsheet documents
that can be worked on.</p>
<p><em>novelibre</em> is primarily designed for authors who are familiar with LibreOffice
or OpenOffice and who are missing the additional administration functions
of specialized writing software.</p>
<p>As a special feature, you can use <em>novelibre</em> in combination with
dedicated timeline software such as the free
<a class="reference external" href="http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/">Timeline</a>
which opens up completely new possibilities for planning
of the narrative plot.</p>
<p>As a computer program, <em>novelibre</em> has to
<a class="reference external" href="saving_data.html">save</a> its data somehow.
To do this, it uses an open and well-documented file format,
so that nobody has to worry that his novel will at some point
“be stuck in the program and no longer wants to come out”.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this online manual provides a comprehensive documentation
of the <em>novelibre</em> features.</p>
<p>However you may have found your way here, I wish you much joy and success
in writing your novel with <em>novelibre</em>!</p>
