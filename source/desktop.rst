Project tree
------------

The project tree in the left pane shows the organization of the project.

-  The tree elements are color-coded according to the section type (see
   `Basic concepts <basic_concepts.html#part-chapter-section-types>`__).
   *Normal* type sections are highlighted according to the selected coloring
   mode (see *Options* in the `View menu <view_menu.html#coloring-mode>`__).
-  The order of the columns can be changed (see *Options* in
   the `View menu <view_menu.html#columns>`__).
-  Right-clicking on a tree element opens a `context
   menu <tree_context_menu.html>`__ with several options.
-  The type of chapters and sections, as well as the completion status
   of the sections are color coded and can be changed via context menu.


Project tree structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The **Book** branch contains the parts, chapters, and sections that
   belong to the novel manuscript.
-  The **Characters/Locations/Items** branches contain descriptions of
   the story world’s elements that can be associated with the book’s
   sections.
-  The **Plot lines** branch contains the `plot lines and plot points
   <plotting.html#defining-plot-lines>`__.
-  The **Project notes** branch contains `project notes
   <project_note_view.html>`__.


Project tree operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Browsing the tree
   *novelibre* has a browsing history for the selected tree elements.
   This allows you to go back and forth e.g. between a section and its
   related characters.

   -  |Go back| selects a node back in the tree browsing history.
   -  |Go forward| selects a node forward in the tree browsing history.

   .. hint::
      On Windows, the "Forward" and "Back" mouse buttons (if any) 
      may also work.


Move tree elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drag and drop while pressing the ``Alt`` key.

.. caution::
   Be aware, there is no "Undo" feature.


Delete tree elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select the element to delete and hit the ``Del`` key.

-  Parts and chapters are deleted.
-  Sections are marked "unused" and moved to the "Trash" chapter.
-  Deleting a part has no effect on its subordinate chapters.
-  Deleting a chapter moves its sections to the "Trash" chapter.
-  The "Trash" chapter is created automatically, if needed.
-  When deleting the "Trash" chapter, all its sections are deleted.


Text viewer
-----------

The **Text viewer** in the middle pane shows the part/chapter/section
contents with their titles as headings.

-  You can open or close the middle pane with the Text viewer with
   **View > Toggle Text viewer**, or ``Ctrl``-``T``, or clicking on
   |Toggle Text viewer|.
-  On opening, the text viewer shows the text where the tree is selected.
-  When changing the tree selection, the text moves along.
-  However, the text can be scrolled independently with the vertical
   scrollbar, or the mousewheel.
-  You can select text with the mouse, and copy it to the clipboard with
   ``Ctrl``-``C``.
-  You cannot edit the text in the viewer.
   For this, you might want to install an editor plugin, such as
   `nv_editor <https://github.com/peter88213/nv_editor/>`__.
-  Section text is color-coded according to the section type (see `Basic
   concepts <basic_concepts.html#part-chapter-section-types>`__).
-  With the **Show markup** checkbox, XML markup can be shown/hidden.


Properties
----------

The `Properties <properties.html>`__ in the right pane show properties
and metadata of the element selected in the project tree.

-  The project settings can be made in the *Book* properties view.
-  You can open or close the element properties window with **View >
   Toggle Properties** or ``Ctrl``-``Alt``-``T``, or clicking on
   |Toggle Properties|.
-  On opening, the windows shows the editable properties of the selected
   element.
-  You can detach or dock the element properties window with **View >
   Detach/Dock Properties** or ``Ctrl``-``Alt``-``D``.
-  On closing the detached window, the properties are docked again.

On large screens, you can arrange *novelibre* and *Writer* with detached
windows.
