*nv_tlview* is a plugin providing a timeline view with sections
that are given a narrative date/day and time.

The plugin adds a **Timeline view** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools** menu,
and a **Timeline view Online help** entry to the **Help** menu.
The Toolbar gets a |Timeline| button.

Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_tlview_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_tlview_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_tlview_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file.

Command reference
-----------------


"Go to" menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First event
   Shift the timeline so that the earliest event
   is positioned near the left edge of the window.

Last event
   Shift the timeline so that the latest event
   is positioned near the right edge of the window.

Selected section
   Shift the timeline so that the section selected in the *novelibre* project tree
   is positioned in the center of the window.


"Scale" menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hours
   This sets the scale to one hour per line.

Fit to window

   valid or substituted date/time information fit into the window.


"Substitutions" menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use 00:00 for missing times
   - If ticked, "00:00" is used as display time for sections without time information.
     This does not affect the section properties.
   - If unticked, sections without time information are not displayed.


"Cascading" menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The section marks are stacked on the timeline canvas, so that they would not
overlap or cover the title of previous sections.
If the stacking algorithm does not seem good enough to you,
you can adjust its limits.

Tight
   Arrange consecutive events behind each other, even if they are close together.

Relaxed
   Arrange consecutive events in a stack, even if they are some distance apart.

Standard
