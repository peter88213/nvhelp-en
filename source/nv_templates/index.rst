**User guide**

This page refers to the latest `nv_templates
<https://github.com/peter88213/nv_templates/>`__ release.
You can open it with **Help > Templates plugin Online help**.


With *novelibre*, you can define a narrative structure with stages. See
`Plotting with novelibre <../plotting.html>`__.
*nv_templates* faciliates the reuse of narrative structures.


Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_templates_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_templates_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_templates_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.

The plugin adds a **Story Templates** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools** menu,
a **Create from Template...** entry to the **File > New** submenu,
and a **Template plugin Online Help** entry to the **Help** menu.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file.

Markdown file structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Story Template* Markdown file defines a narrative structure with
the help of headings and ordinary text.

First level heading for top level stages, e.g. acts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first level heading begins with ``#``, followed by a space and a
stage title.

Second level heading for minor stages or turning points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second level heading begins with ``##``, followed by a space and a

Ordinary text

Any text under a heading is used as notes for the element
generated from the heading.
