Manuscript for editing
----------------------

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Export >  Manuscript for editing**,
you can create a text document that is split into sections
(to be seen in the Navigator).
File name suffix is ``_manuscript_tmp``.

-  Only "normal" chapters and sections are exported. Chapters and
   sections marked "unused" are not exported.
-  Section titles are invisible, but appear in the *Navigator*.
-  Chapters and sections can neither be rearranged nor deleted.
-  With *Writer*, you can split sections by
   inserting headings or a section divider:

   -  *Heading 1* → New part title. Optionally, you can add a
      description, separated by ``|``.
   -  *Heading 2* → New chapter title. Optionally, you can add a
      description, separated by ``|``.
   -  ``###`` → Section divider. Optionally, you can append the section
      title to the section divider. You can also add a description,
      separated by ``|``.

   .. important:: 
      Documents with split sections are automatically
      discarded after the *novelibre* project is updated.

-  Text markup: Bold and italics are supported. Other highlighting such
   as underline and strikethrough are lost.
-  Change tracking: All changes are accepted on import.
   Change tracking data is lost.


Manuscript for third-party word processing
------------------------------------------

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Export >  Manuscript for third-party word processing**,
you can create a text document with visible section markers.
File name suffix is ``_proof_tmp``.

.. note::
   This document retains its section information even if it is 
   converted to other formats and back again. This may work with 
   popular commercial word processors and even with web-based word 
   processors such as Google Docs. 


-  Only "normal" chapters and sections are exported. Chapters and
   sections marked "unused" are not exported.
-  The document contains chapter and section headings. However, changes
   will not be reimported.
-  The document contains section ``[scx]`` markers. **Do not touch lines
   containing the markers** if you want to be able to write the document
   back to *novelibre* format.
-  Chapters and sections can neither be rearranged nor deleted.
-  When editing the document, you can split sections by inserting
   headings or a section divider:

   -  *Heading 1* → New part title. Optionally, you can add a
      description, separated by ``|``.
   -  *Heading 2* → New chapter title. Optionally, you can add a
      description, separated by ``|``.
   -  ``###`` → Section divider. Optionally, you can append the section
      title to the section divider. You can also add a description,
      separated by ``|``.

   .. important:: 
      Documents with split sections are automatically
      discarded after the *novelibre* project is updated.

-  Text markup: Bold and italics are supported. Other highlighting such
   as underline and strikethrough are lost.
-  Change tracking: All changes are accepted on import.
   Change tracking data is lost.


Final manuscript document (export only)
---------------------------------------

**Export an ODT document**

With **Export >  Final manuscript document (export only)**,
you can create a text document for further use,
e.g. a final document when you are finished with *novelibre*.

.. hint::
   In contrast to the manuscript for editing, this document is not divided 
   internally into sections, which could facilitate further processing and 
   reformatting. 


-  The document is placed in the same folder as the project.
-  Document’s **filename**: ``<project name>.odt``.
-  Only "normal" chapters and sections are exported. Chapters and
   sections marked "unused" are not exported.
-  Part titles appear as first level heading.
-  Chapter titles appear as second level heading.
-  Sections are separated by ``* * *``. The first line is not indented.
-  Starting from the second paragraph, paragraphs begin with indentation
   of the first line.
-  Sections marked "attach to previous section" appear like continuous
   paragraphs.
-  Text markup: Bold and italics are supported. Other highlighting such
   as underline and strikethrough are lost.
-  The first paragraph of each chapter is assigned the paragraph style
   *Chapter beginning* which is by default like the body text without
   indentiation.
   By modifying this paragraph style you can give a special look
   to the beginnings ot the chapters, e.g. with initials.

.. tip::
   If you prefer simple blank lines instead of the three-asterisks
   in your final document,
   you can achieve this using "Find and replace".
   This is particularly convenient with a macro that comes with the
   `novelibre-tools <https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre-tools/>`__
   extension.


Brief synopsis (export only)
----------------------------

   sections marked "unused" are not exported.

locations, items, and plot lines with all their properties.
These files can be used to transfer the elements to another projects.

.. hint::
   To import XML data files from another project, use the **Import**
   command in the **Characters**, **Locations**, **Items**, or **Plot** menu.

**Project independent program settings**

With **Export >  Options**,
You can open a dialog for settings concerning the document export.


Ask before opening exported documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This checkbox controls the behavior on document export.

- If ticked, you will be asked whether you want to
  have *novelibre* launch *Writer* or *Calc* with the newly created
  document opened.

- If unticked, *novelibre* will launch *Writer* or
  *Calc* with the newly created document opened right away.


Lock the project after document export for editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This checkbox controls the behavior on opening documents for editing.

- If ticked, *novelibre* will `lock the project
  <basic_concepts.html#project-lock>`__ when launching *Writer* or *Calc*.

- If unticked, *novelibre* won't lock the project when launching
  *Writer* or *Calc*.


Select document template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can have *novelibre* apply your own styles so that the exported text
documents better suit your taste and habits.

If you click on this button, a file select dialog will open.
You can select either an *.ott* document template or an *.odt* document.
*novelibre* will adopt the selected document's styles
and use them for ODT document export.


Restore default styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you click on this button, *novelibre* will discard the styles loaded
