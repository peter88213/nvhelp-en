**User guide**

This page refers to the latest `nv_clipboard
<https://github.com/peter88213/nv_clipboard/>`__ release.
You can open it with **Help > Collection plugin Online help**.


Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_clipboard_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_clipboard_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_clipboard_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.

The plugin adds two buttons to the *novelibre* `toolbar <../toolbar.html>`__,
and a **Clipboard Online help** entry to the **Help** menu.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file.
