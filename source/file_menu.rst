**Create a new novel project**

With **File > New**, you can create a new project.

Empty project
   -  This will close the current project and create a blank project.
   -  A file select dialog asks for the new project’s file name.
      If you cancel the dialog, you can select the file name later
      when saving the project.


Create from ODT...
   -  This will close the current project and open a file dialog asking
      for an ODT document to create the new projec from.
   -  The newly created project is saved automatically in the same
      directory as the ODT document, using its file name and the extension
      *.novx*.
   -  If a project with the same file name as the ODT document already
      exists, no new project will be created.
   -  If you select a previously exported document belonging to an existing
      project, this project will be updated and loaded.
   -  The ODT document can either be a `work in progress
      <getting_started.html#starting-with-a-work-in-progress>`__,
      i.e. a regular novel manuscript with chapter headings and section contents,
      r an `outline <getting_started.html#starting-with-an-outline>`__
      containing the chapter and section structure with titles and descriptions.

Copy style sheet
----------------

.. hint::

   Depending on your web browser and your operating system, the
   *content type* resp. *MIME type* of *.novx* files must be registered as
   *"text/xml"*. Under Windows, yo can do this by running the
   ``<home>\.novx\add_novelibre.reg`` script.

------------------

**Discard the current manuscript by renaming it**

With **File > Discard manuscript**,
