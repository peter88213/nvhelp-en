**User guide**

This page refers to the latest `nv_collection
<https://github.com/peter88213/nv_collection/>`__ release.
You can open it with **Help > Collection plugin Online help**.

If you have several *novelibre* projects,
you can manage them as books in a collection, also organized by series.
A collection gives you quick access to your projects.

Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_collection_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_collection_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_collection_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.

The plugin adds a **Collection** entry to the *novelibre* **File** menu,
and a **Collection plugin Online help** entry to the **Help** menu.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file.
