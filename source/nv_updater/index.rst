Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_updater_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_updater_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_updater_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file. 


Start the update checker
------------------------


Open the update checker from the main menu: **Tools > Check for updates**.

If an update is found, a message pops up.

You can choose:

   -  **Yes** starts your web browser with the update URL.
   -  **No** skips this update.
   -  **Cancel** cancels the update check.

.. important::
   The *nv_updater* plugin only initiates the download process via the
   system web browser. If a download directory is preset, all zip files
   with the downloaded releases will end up there. You then perform the
   actual installation manually as usual.

If no update is found, a message pops up at the end.
